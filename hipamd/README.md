## Repository branches:

The hipamd repository maintains several branches. The branches that are of importance are:

* Main branch: This is the stable branch. It is up to date with the latest release branch, for example, if the latest HIP release is rocm-4.4, main branch will be the repository based on this release.
* Develop branch: This is the default branch, on which the new features are still under development and visible. While this maybe of interest to many, it should be noted that this branch and the features under development might not be stable.
* Release branches. These are branches corresponding to each ROCM release, listed with release tags, such as rocm-4.4, etc.

## Release tagging:

hipamd releases are typically naming convention for each ROCM release to help differentiate them.

* rocm x.yy: These are the stable releases based on the ROCM release.
  This type of release is typically made once a month.*
