/** \file Concatenating hostcalls into a message
 *
 *  A message is a stream of 64-bit integers transmitted as a series
 *  of hostcall invocations by the device code. Although the hostcall
 *  is "warp-wide", the message for each workitem is distinct.
 *
 *  Of the eight uint64_t arguments in hostcall, the first argument is
 *  used as the message descriptor, while the rest are used for
 *  message contents. The descriptor consists of the following fields:
 *
 *  - Bit  0     is the BEGIN flag.
 *  - Bit  1     is the END flag.
 *  - Bits 2-4   are reserved and must be zero.
 *  - Bits 5-7   indicate the number of elements being transmitted.
 *  - Bits 8-63  contain a 56-bit message ID.
 *
 *  A hostcall with the BEGIN flag set in the descriptor indicates the
 *  start of a new message. A hostcall with the END flag set indicates
 *  the end of a message. A single hostcall can have both flags set if
 *  the message fits in the payload of a single hostcall.  Each
 *  hostcall indicates the number of uint64_t elements in the payload
 *  that contain data to be appended to the message.
 *
 *  When the message receives a hostcall with the BEGIN flag set, it allocates a
 *  new message ID, which is transmitted to the device via the first return
 *  value in the hostcall. Every subsequent hostcall containing the same message
 *  ID appends its payload to that message. The message is said to be "active"
 *  until a corresponding END hostcall is received.
 *
 *  When the message handler receives a hostcall with the END flag set, it
 *  invokes the corresponding message handler on the contents of the
 *  accumulated message, and then discards the message. The handler
 *  may return up to two uint64_t values, that are transmitted to the
 *  device via the return value of the last hostcall.
 *
 *  Behaviour is undefined in each of the following cases:
 *  - An END packet is received with a non-existent message ID, or with
 *    the ID of an inactive message (previously terminated by an END packet).
 *  - No END packet is received for an active message.
 *  - Any of the reserved bits are non-zero.
 *  - Different hostcalls indicate the same active message ID but a
 *    different service.
