# Change Log for HIP

Full documentation for HIP is available at [rocm.docs.amd.com](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/index.html)

## HIP 7.0 for ROCm 7.0

### Added

* New HIP APIs
    - `hipLaunchKernelEx`  dispatches the provided kernel with the given launch configuration and forwards the kernel arguments.
    - `hipLaunchKernelExC`  launches a HIP kernel using a generic function pointer and the specified configuration.
    - `hipDrvLaunchKernelEx`  dispatches the device kernel represented by a HIP function object.
    - `hipMemGetHandleForAddressRange`  gets a handle for the address range requested.
* New support for Open Compute Project (OCP) floating-point `FP4`/`FP6`/`FP8` as the following. For details, see [Low precision floating point document](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/reference/low_fp_types.html).
    - Data types for `FP4`/`FP6`/`FP8`.
    - HIP APIs for `FP4`/`FP6`/`FP8`, which are compatible with corresponding CUDA APIs.
    - HIP Extensions APIs for microscaling formats, which are supported on AMD GPUs.
* New `wptr` and `rptr` values in `ClPrint`, for better logging in dispatch barrier methods.
* New debug mask, to print precise code object information for logging.
* The `_sync()` version of crosslane builtins such as `shfl_sync()` and `__reduce_add_sync` are enabled by default. These can be disabled by setting the preprocessor macro `HIP_DISABLE_WARP_SYNC_BUILTINS`.

### Changed

* Some unsupported GPUs such as gfx9, gfx8 and gfx7 are deprecated on Microsoft Windows.
* Stream validation in some HIP APIs are removed, to match the behavior with CUDA.

### Optimized

HIP runtime has the following functional improvements which greatly improve runtime performance and user experience.

* Reduced usage of the lock scope in events and kernel handling.
    - Switches to `shared_mutex` for event validation, uses `std::unique_lock` in HIP runtime to create/destroy event, instead of `scopedLock`.
    - Reduces the `scopedLock` in handling of kernel execution. HIP runtime now calls `scopedLock` during kernel binary creation/initialization,
    doesn't call it again during kernel vector iteration before launch.
* Implementation of unifying managed buffer and kernel argument buffer so HIP runtime doesn't need to create/load a separate kernel argument buffer.
* Refactored memory validation, creates a unique function to validate a variety of memory copy operations.
* Improved kernel logging using demangling shader names.
* Advanced support for SPIRV, now kernel compilation caching is enabled by default. This feature is controlled by the environment variable `AMD_COMGR_CACHE`, for details, see [hip_rtc document](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/how-to/hip_rtc.html).
* Programmatic support for scratch limit on GPU device. Developer can now use the environment variable `HSA_SCRATCH_SINGLE_LIMIT` to change the default allocation size with expected scratch limit.
* HIP runtime now enables peer-to-peer (P2P) memory copies to utilize all available SDMA engines, rather than being limited to a single engine. It also selects the best engine first to give optimal bindwidth.
* Improved launch latency for `D2D` copies and `memset` on MI300 series.

### Resolved issues

* Error of "unable to find modules" in HIP clean up for code object module.

## HIP 6.4.2 for ROCm 6.4.2

### Added

* Support for the pointer attribute `HIP_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_CONTEXT`.

### Optimized

* Improved implementation in `hipEventSynchronize`, HIP runtime now makes internal callbacks non-blocking to gain performance.

### Resolved issues

* Issue of dependency on `libgcc-s1` during rocm-dev install on Debian Buster. HIP runtime removed this Debian package dependency, and uses `libgcc1` instead for this distros.
* Building issue for `COMGR` dynamic load on Fedora and other Distros. HIP runtime now doesn't link against `libamd_comgr.so`.
* Failure in the API `hipStreamDestroy`, when stream type is `hipStreamLegacy`. The API now returns error code `hipErrorInvalidResourceHandle` on this condition.
* Kernel launch errors, such as `shared object initialization failed`, `invalid device function` or `kernel execution failure`. HIP runtime now loads `COMGR` properly considering the file with its name and mapped mage.
* Memory access fault in some appplications. HIP runtime fixed offset accumulation in memory address.

## HIP 6.4.1 for ROCm 6.4.1

### Added

* New log mask enumeration `LOG_COMGR` enables logging precise code object information.

### Changed

* HIP runtime uses device bitcode before SPIRV.
* The implementation of preventing `hipLaunchKernel` latency degradation with number of idle streams is reverted/disabled by default.

### Optimized

* Improved kernel logging includes de-mangling shader names.
* Refined implementation in HIP APIs `hipEventRecords` and `hipStreamWaitEvent` for performance improvement.

### Resolved issues

* Stale state during the graph capture. The return error was fixed, HIP runtime now always uses the latest dependent nodes during `hipEventRecord` capture.
* Segmentation fault during kernel execution. HIP runtime now allows maximum stack size as per ISA on the GPU device.

## HIP 6.4 (For ROCm 6.4)

### Added

* New HIP APIs
    - `hipDeviceGetTexture1DLinearMaxWidth`  returns the maximum width of elements in a 1D linear texture, that can be allocated on the specified device.
    - `hipStreamBatchMemOp`  enqueues an array of batch memory operations in the stream, for stream synchronization.
    - `hipGraphAddBatchMemOpNode`  creates a batch memory operation node and adds it to a graph.
    - `hipGraphBatchMemOpNodeGetParams`  returns the pointer of parameters from the batch memory operation node.
    - `hipGraphBatchMemOpNodeSetParams`  sets parameters for the batch memory operation node.
    - `hipGraphExecBatchMemOpNodeSetParams`  sets the parameters for a batch memory operation node in the given executable graph.
    - `hipLinkAddData` adds SPIRV code object data to linker instance with options.
    - `hipLinkAddFile` adds SPIRV code object file to linker instance with options.
    - `hipLinkCreate`  creates linker instance at runtime with options.
    - `hipLinkComplete` completes linking of program and output linker binary to use with hipModuleLoadData.
    - `hipLinkDestroy`  deletes linker instance.

### Changed

* roc-obj* tools are being deprecated, and will be removed in an upcoming release.
    - Perl package dependencies are now RECOMMENDS or SUGGESTS.  Users will need to install these themselves.
    - Support for ROCm Object tooling has moved into llvm-objdump provided by package rocm-llvm.
* SDMA retainer logic is removed for engine selection in operation of runtime buffer copy.

### Optimized

* `hipGraphLaunch` parallelism is improved for complex data-parallel graphs.
* Round-robin queue mechanism is updated for command scheduling. For multi-streams execution, HSA queue from null stream lock is freed and won't occupy the queue ID after the kernel in the stream is finished.
* The HIP runtime doesn't free bitcode object before code generation. It adds a cache, which allows compiled code objects to be reused instead of recompiling. This improves performance on multi-GPU systems.
* Runtime uses unified copy approach
    - Unpinned `H2D`copies are no longer blocking until the size of 1MB.
    - Kernel copy path is enabled for unpinned `H2D`/`D2H` methods.
    - The default environment variable `GPU_FORCE_BLIT_COPY_SIZE` is set to `16`, which limits the kernel copy to sizes less than 16 KB, while copies about that would be handled by `SDMA` engine.
    - Blit code is refactored and ASAN instrumentation is cleaned up.
* HIP runtime uses signals without interrupts.
    - In active wait mode, uses signals without interrupts by default.
    - Only when a callback is required, switches to the interrupts.

### Resolved issues

* Out of memory error on Windows. When the user calls `hipMalloc` for device memory allocation while specifying a size larger than the available device memory, the HIP runtime fixes the error in the API implementation, allocating the available device memory plus system memory (shared virtual memory).
* Error of dependency on libgcc-s1 during rocm-dev install on Debian Buster. HIP runtime now uses libgcc1 for this distros.
* Stack corruption during kernel execution. HIP runtime now adds maximum stack size limit based on the GPU device feature.

### Upcoming changes

The following are the list of backwards incompatible changes planned for the upcoming major ROCm release.

* Signature changes in APIs to match corresponding CUDA APIs,
    - `hiprtcCreateProgram`
    - `hiprtcCompileProgram`
    - `hipCtxGetApiVersion`
* Behavior of `hipPointerGetAttributes` is changed to match corresponding CUDA API in version 11 and later releases.
* Behavior of `hipFree` is changed to match corresponding CUDA API `cudaFree`.
* HIP vector constructor changes for `hipComplex`.
* Return error/value codes update in the following hip APIs, they now match the corresponding CUDA APIs,
    - `hipModuleLaunchKernel`
    - `hipExtModuleLaunchKernel`
    - `hipModuleLaunchCooperativeKernel`
    - `hipGetTextureAlignmentOffset`
    - `hipTexObjectCreate`
    - `hipBindTexture2D`
    - `hipBindTextureToArray`
    - `hipModuleLoad`
    - `hipLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`
    - `hipExtLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`
 
* HIPRTC implementation, the compilation of hiprtc now uses  namespace ` __hip_internal`, instead of the standard headers `std`.
* Stream capture mode update in the following hip APIs. Stream can only be captured in relax mode, to match the behavior of the corresponding CUDA APIs,
   - `hipMallocManaged`
   - `hipMemAdvise`
   - `hipLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`
   - `hipDeviceSetCacheConfig`
   - `hipDeviceSetSharedMemConfig`
   - `hipMemPoolCreate`
   - `hipMemPoolDestory`
   - `hipDeviceSetMemPool`
   - `hipEventQuery`
* The implementation of `hipStreamAddCallback` is updated, to match the behavior of CUDA.
* Removal of hiprtc symbols from hip library.
    - hiprtc will be a independent library, all symbols supported in hip library are removed.
    - Any application using hiprtc APIs should link explicitly with hiprtc library.
    - This change makes the usage of hiprtc library on Linux the same as on Windows, and matches the behavior of CUDA nvrtc.
* Removal of deprecated struct `HIP_MEMSET_NODE_PARAMS`, developers can use definition `hipMemsetParams` instead.


## HIP 6.3.2 for ROCm 6.3.2

### Added

* Tracking of Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) handlers:
    - Adds an atomic counter to track the outstanding HSA handlers.
    - Waits on CPU for the callbacks if the number exceeds the defined value.
* Codes to capture Architected Queueing Language (AQL) packets for HIP graph memory copy node between host and device. HIP enqueues AQL packets during graph launch.
* Control to use system pool implementation in runtime commands handling. By default, it is disabled.
* A new path to avoid `WaitAny` calls in `AsyncEventsLoop`. The new path is selected by default.
* Runtime control on decrement counter only if event is popped. There is a new way to restore dead signals cleanup for the old path.
* A new logic in runtime to track the age of events from the kernel mode driver.

### Optimized

* HSA callback performance. The HIP runtime creates and submits commands in the queue and interacts with HSA through a callback function. HIP waits for the CPU status from HSA to optimize handling of events, profiling, commands, and HSA signals for higher performance.
* Runtime optimisation which combines all logic of `WaitAny` in a single processing loop and avoids extra memory allocations or reference counting. The runtime won't spin on the CPU if all events are busy.
* Multi-threaded dispatches for performance improvement.
* Command submissions and processing between CPU and GPU by introducing a way to limit the software batch size.
* Switch to `std::shared_mutex` in book/keep logic in streams from multiple threads simultaneously, for performance improvement in specific customer applications.
* `std::shared_mutex` is used in memory object mapping, for performance improvement.

### Resolved issues

* Race condition in multi-threaded producer/consumer scenario with `hipMallocFromPoolAsync`.
* Segmentation fault with `hipStreamLegacy` while using the API `hipStreamWaitEvent`.
* Usage of `hipStreamLegacy` in HIP event record.
* A soft hang in graph execution process from HIP user object. The fix handles the release of graph execution object properly considering synchronization on the device/stream. The user application now behaves the same with  hipUserObject  on both the AMD ROCm and NVIDIA CUDA platforms.


## HIP 6.3.1 for ROCm 6.3.1

### Added

* An activeQueues set that tracks only the queues that have a command submitted to them, which allows fast iteration in `waitActiveStreams`.

### Optimized

* Mechanism of preventing `hipLaunchKernel` latency degradation with number of idle streams is implemented for performance improvement.

## HIP 6.3 for ROCm 6.3

### Added

* New HIP APIs
    - `hipGraphExecGetFlags`  returns the flags on executable graph.
    - `hipGraphNodeSetParams`  updates parameters of a created node.
    - `hipGraphExecNodeSetParams`  updates parameters of a created node on executable graph.
    - `hipDrvGraphMemcpyNodeGetParams`  gets a memcpy node's parameters.
    - `hipDrvGraphMemcpyNodeSetParams`  sets a memcpy node's parameters.
    - `hipDrvGraphAddMemFreeNode`  creates a memory free node and adds it to a graph.
    - `hipDrvGraphExecMemcpyNodeSetParams`  sets the parameters for a memcpy node in the given graphExec.
    - `hipDrvGraphExecMemsetNodeSetParams`  sets the parameters for a memset node in the given graphExec.

### Changed

* Un-deprecated HIP APIs
    - `hipHostAlloc`
    - `hipFreeHost`

### Optimized

* Disabled CPU wait in device synchronize to avoid idle time in applications such as Hugging Face models and PyTorch.
* Optimized multi-threaded dispatches to improve performance.
* Limited the software batch size to control the number of command submissions for runtime to handle efficiently.
* Optimizes HSA callback performance when a large number of events are recorded by multiple threads and submitted to multiple GPUs.
* HIP graph execution perfomance improvement.
    - Added the optimized multistream path in graph execution. It uses a fixed number of async streams in the execution
    - Optimized the launch latency, where commands creation and execution is done at the same time
    - Optimized the scheduling to use less barriers and waiting signals if the same queue  can be detected
    - The new path is controlled by a new environment variable, with the options either to use the original path, or to force the number of asynchronous queues for execution.

### Resolved issues

* Soft hang in runtime wait event when run TensorFlow.
* Memory leak in the API `hipGraphInstantiate` when kernel is launched using `hipExtLaunchKernelGGL` with event.
* Memory leak when the API `hipGraphAddMemAllocNode` is called.
* The `_sync()` version of crosslane builtins such as `shfl_sync()`,
  `__all_sync()` and `__any_sync()`, continue to be hidden behind the
  preprocessor macro `HIP_ENABLE_WARP_SYNC_BUILTINS`, and will be enabled
  unconditionally in the next ROCm release.


## HIP 6.2.41134 for ROCm 6.2.1

### Resolved issues

* Soft hang when use AMD_SERIALIZE_KERNEL.
* Memory leak in hipIpcCloseMemHandle.


## HIP 6.2 (For ROCm 6.2)

### Added
- Introduced the `_sync()` version of crosslane builtins such as `shfl_sync()`, `__all_sync()`
  and `__any_sync()`. These take a 64-bit integer as an explicit mask argument.
  - In HIP 6.2, these are hidden behind the preprocessor macro
    `HIP_ENABLE_WARP_SYNC_BUILTINS`, and will be enabled unconditionally in HIP 6.3.
- Added new HIP APIs
    - `hipGetProcAddress` returns the pointer to driver function, corresponding to the defined driver function symbol.
    - `hipGetFuncBySymbol` returns the pointer to device entry function that matches entry function symbolPtr.
    - `hipStreamBeginCaptureToGraph` begins graph capture on a stream to an existing graph.
    - `hipGraphInstantiateWithParams`  creates an executable graph from a graph.
    - `hipMemcpyAtoA`  copies from one 1D array to another.
    - `hipMemcpyDtoA`  copies from device memory to a 1D array.
    - `hipMemcpyAtoD`  copies from one 1D array to device memory.
    - `hipMemcpyAtoHAsync`  copies from one 1D array to host memory.
    - `hipMemcpyHtoAAsync`  copies from host memory to a 1D array.
    - `hipMemcpy2DArrayToArray`  copies data between host and device.

- Added a new flag `integrated` support in device property

    The `integrated` flag is added in the struct `hipDeviceProp_t`.
    On the integrated `APU` system, the runtime driver detects and sets this flag to `1`, in which case the API `hipDeviceGetAttribute` returns enum `hipDeviceAttribute_t` for hipDeviceAttributeIntegrated as value `1`, for integrated GPU device.

    The enum value `hipDeviceAttributeIntegrated` corresponds to `cudaDevAttrIntegrated` on CUDA platform.
- Added initial support for 8-bit floating point datatype in `amd_hip_fp8.h`. These are accessible via `#include <hip/hip_fp8.h>`
- Add UUID support for environment variable `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

### Resolved issues
- Stream capture support in HIP graph.
Prohibited and unhandled operations are fixed during stream capture in HIP runtime.
- Fix undefined symbol error for hipTexRefGetArray & hipTexRefGetBorderColor.

## HIP 6.1 (For ROCm 6.1)

### Added
- New environment variable HIP_LAUNCH_BLOCKING
It is used for serialization on kernel execution.
The default value is 0 (disable), kernel will execute normally as defined in the queue. When this environment variable is set as 1 (enable), HIP runtime will serialize kernel enqueue, behaves the same as AMD_SERIALIZE_KERNEL.
- Added HIPRTC support for hip headers driver_types, math_functions, library_types, math_functions, hip_math_constants, channel_descriptor, device_functions, hip_complex, surface_types, texture_types.

### Changed
- HIPRTC now assumes WGP mode for gfx10+. CU mode can be enabled by passing `-mcumode` to the compile options from `hiprtcCompileProgram`.

### Resolved issues
- HIP complex vector type multiplication and division operations.
On AMD platform, some duplicated complex operators are removed to avoid compilation failures.
In HIP, hipFloatComplex and hipDoubleComplex are defined as complex data types,
typedef float2 hipFloatComplex;
typedef double2 hipDoubleComplex;
Any application uses complex multiplication and division operations, need to replace '*' and '/' operators with the following,
    - hipCmulf() and hipCdivf() for hipFloatComplex
    - hipCmul() and hipCdiv() for hipDoubleComplex

    Note: These complex operations are equivalent to corresponding types/functions on NVIDIA platform.

## HIP 6.0 (For ROCm 6.0)

### Added
- Addition of hipExtGetLastError
  - AMD backend specific API, to return error code from last HIP API called from the active host thread

- New fields for external resource interoperability,
  - Structs
    - hipExternalMemoryHandleDesc_st
    - hipExternalMemoryBufferDesc_st
    - hipExternalSemaphoreHandleDesc_st
    - hipExternalSemaphoreSignalParams_st
    - hipExternalSemaphoreWaitParams_st
  - Enumerations
    - hipExternalMemoryHandleType_enum
    - hipExternalSemaphoreHandleType_enum
    - hipExternalMemoryHandleType_enum

- New members are added in HIP struct hipDeviceProp_t, for new feature capabilities including,
  - Texture
     - int maxTexture1DMipmap;
     - int maxTexture2DMipmap[2];
     - int maxTexture2DLinear[3];
     - int maxTexture2DGather[2];
     - int maxTexture3DAlt[3];
     - int maxTextureCubemap;
     - int maxTexture1DLayered[2];
     - int maxTexture2DLayered[3];
     - int maxTextureCubemapLayered[2];
  - Surface
     - int maxSurface1D;
     - int maxSurface2D[2];
     - int maxSurface3D[3];
     - int maxSurface1DLayered[2];
     - int maxSurface2DLayered[3];
     - int maxSurfaceCubemap;
     - int maxSurfaceCubemapLayered[2];
  - Device
     - hipUUID uuid;
     - char luid[8];
       -- this is 8-byte unique identifier. Only valid on windows
       -- LUID (Locally Unique Identifier) is supported for interoperability between devices.
     - unsigned int luidDeviceNodeMask; \

     Note: HIP supports LUID only on Windows OS.
- Added `amd_hip_bf16.h` which adds `bfloat16` type. These definitions are accessible via `#include <hip/hip_bf16.h>`
This header exists alongside the older bfloat16 header in`amd_hip_bfloat16.h` which is included via `hip/hip_bfloat16.h`. Users are recommended to use `<hip/hip_bf16.h>` instead of `<hip/hip_bfloat16.h>`.

### Changed
- Some OpenGL Interop HIP APIs are moved from the hip_runtime_api header to a new header file hip_gl_interop.h for the AMD platform, as following,
    - hipGLGetDevices
    - hipGraphicsGLRegisterBuffer
    - hipGraphicsGLRegisterImage
- With ROCm 6.0, the HIP version is 6.0. As the HIP runtime binary suffix is updated in every major ROCm release, in ROCm 6.0, the new filename is libamdhip64.so.6. Furthermore, in ROCm 6.0 release, the libamdhip64.so.5 binary from ROCm 5.7 is made available to maintain binary backward compatibility with ROCm 5.x.

### Changed Impacting Backward Compatibility
- Data types for members in HIP_MEMCPY3D structure are changed from "unsigned int" to "size_t".
- The value of the flag hipIpcMemLazyEnablePeerAccess is changed to “0x01”, which was previously defined as “0”.
- Some device property attributes are not currently support in HIP runtime, in order to maintain consistency, the following related enumeration names are changed in hipDeviceAttribute_t
    - hipDeviceAttributeName is changed to hipDeviceAttributeUnused1
    - hipDeviceAttributeUuid is changed to hipDeviceAttributeUnused2
    - hipDeviceAttributeArch is changed to hipDeviceAttributeUnused3
    - hipDeviceAttributeGcnArch is changed to hipDeviceAttributeUnused4
    - hipDeviceAttributeGcnArchName is changed to hipDeviceAttributeUnused5
- HIP struct hipArray is removed from driver type header to be complying with cuda
- hipArray_t replaces hipArray*, as the pointer to array.
    - This allows hipMemcpyAtoH and hipMemcpyHtoA to have the correct array type which is equivalent to coresponding CUDA driver APIs.

### Removed
- Deprecated Heterogeneous Compute (HCC) symbols and flags are removed from the HIP source code, including,
    - Build options on obsolete HCC_OPTIONS was removed from cmake.
    - Micro definitions are removed.
      HIP_INCLUDE_HIP_HCC_DETAIL_DRIVER_TYPES_H
      HIP_INCLUDE_HIP_HCC_DETAIL_HOST_DEFINES_H
    - Compilation flags for the platform definitions,
      AMD platform,
      __HIP_PLATFORM_HCC__
      __HCC__
      __HIP_ROCclr__
      NVIDIA platform,
      __HIP_PLATFORM_NVCC__
- File directories in the clr repository are removed,
  https://github.com/ROCm/clr/blob/develop/hipamd/include/hip/hcc_detail
  https://github.com/ROCm/clr/blob/develop/hipamd/include/hip/nvcc_detail
- Deprecated gcnArch is removed from hip device struct hipDeviceProp_t.
- Deprecated "enum hipMemoryType memoryType;" is removed from HIP struct hipPointerAttribute_t union.
- Deprecated HIT based tests are removed from HIP project
- Catch tests are available [hip-tests] (https://github.com/ROCm/hip-tests) project

### Resolved issues
- Kernel launch maximum dimension validation is added specifically on gridY and gridZ in the HIP API hipModule-LaunchKernel. As a result,when hipGetDeviceAttribute is called for the value of hipDeviceAttributeMaxGrid-Dim, the behavior on the AMD platform is equivalent to NVIDIA.
- The HIP stream synchronisation behavior is changed in internal stream functions, in which a flag "wait" is added and set when the current stream is null pointer while executing stream synchronisation on other explicitly created streams. This change avoids blocking of execution on null/default stream.
The change won't affect usage of applications, and makes them behave the same on the AMD platform as NVIDIA.
- Error handling behavior on unsupported GPU is fixed, HIP runtime will log out error message, instead of creating signal abortion error which is invisible to developers but continued kernel execution process. This is for the case when developers compile any application via hipcc, setting the option --offload-arch with GPU ID which is different from the one on the system.

### Known Issues
- Dynamically loaded HIP runtime library references incorrect version of hipDeviceGetProperties and hipChooseDevice APIs

When an application dynamically loads the HIP runtime library from ROCm 6.0 and attempts to get the hipDeviceGetProperties and/or hipChooseDevice entry-points using dlsym, the application gets the older version (ROCm 5.7) of those entry-points.

As a workaround, while compiling with ROCm 6.0, use the string "hipDeviceGetPropertiesR0600", and "hipChooseDeviceR0600" respectively for hipDeviceGetProperties and hipChooseDevice APIs.

## HIP 5.7.1 (For ROCm 5.7.1)

### Resolved issues
- hipPointerGetAttributes API returns the correct HIP memory type as hipMemoryTypeManaged for managed memory.

## HIP 5.7 (For ROCm 5.7)

### Added

    - hipMallocMipmappedArray for allocating a mipmapped array on the device

    - hipFreeMipmappedArray for freeing a mipmapped array on the device

    - hipGetMipmappedArrayLevel for getting a mipmap level of a HIP mipmapped array

    - hipMipmappedArrayCreate for creating a mipmapped array

    - hipMipmappedArrayDestroy for destroy a mipmapped array

    - hipMipmappedArrayGetLevel for getting a mipmapped array on a mipmapped level

### Known Issues
- HIP memory type enum values currently don't support equivalent value to cudaMemoryTypeUnregistered, due to HIP functionality backward compatibility.
- HIP API hipPointerGetAttributes could return invalid value in case the input memory pointer was not allocated through any HIP API on device or host.
